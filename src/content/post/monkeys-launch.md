Shortly under a year after leaving Google, and after launching several [smaller](https://hn.zip) [projects](https://deadlock.zip), I'm so excited to announce the launch of [monkeys.zip](https://monkeys.zip)!

<center><i>Pick a monkey!</i></center>

Based on the [Infinite Monkey Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem), monkeys.zip is a game(?) where users can claim a monkey on the Infinite Grid - this monkey will continually type, as we check each letter written against all the works of Shakespeare! Monkeys are awarded with points and cosmetic items for writing words, while we track the global performance and see how much of Shakespeare's works we can write!

It has no microtransactions, no ads, no monetization of any form. I originally considered selling monkeys for $5 a pop - but I'd rather have more people enjoy it than try to profit off of such a silly concept.

***UPDATE:*** 1 month later, monkeys.zip has over 11,000 monkeys, a (slightly active) [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/monkeyszip), and has received a lot of love! I've now posted a [making-of](/posts/making-of-monkeys) for the site.
