Today I procrastinated working on my upcoming project and instead made a quick note taking tool, [quicknote.zip](https://quicknote.zip).

I frequently want to write short notes, a todo list for a day, jot down some thoughts - and often use [doc.new](https://doc.new) which opens a new empty Google Doc. However this is too heavy for most of my needs, takes maybe 2 seconds to fully load and be interactable, and clogs up my google drive with lots of "Untitled Document" that just has items like "buy ham" in it.

[quicknote](https://quicknote.zip) loads faster than you can blink, works offline, and gives you a fresh notepad each day, storing to localstorage. That's it, that's all it does.
