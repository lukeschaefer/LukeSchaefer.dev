		<p> In April 2025 I launched <a href="https://monkeys.zip"><b>monkeys.zip</b></a>, which is my most popular project <i>(yet)</i>.		</p>

		<p>
			<i>Before that,</i> I worked at Google for 8 wonderful years - where I learned a lot about how
			to make software using Google tooling and infrastructure.</p>
			
		<p><i>Before that,</i> I worked at BlackRock for 6 months - where I learned that employers don't like 
			when you leave after 6 months. 
		</p>
    <p>
      Throughout that time, I worked on many side projects, the vast majority have never 
      seen the light of day because I was afraid of putting myself out there, and I'm trying to make up for that now.
